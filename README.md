# 8_Bit_ALU_in_verilog
An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a key component in digital systems, including CPUs. It performs essential arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, logic operations such as AND and OR, and bitwise operations. The ALU's efficiency impacts overall processor performance, making it crucial for executing fundamental computing tasks.


# Operationa codes 
| SL.NO | opcode | Operations|
|-------|--------|------------|
|1|000|Result = operand1 + operand2|
|2|001|Result = operand1 - operand2|
|3|010|Result = operand1 * operand2|
|4|011|Result = operand1 & operand2|
|5|100|Result = operand1 | operand2|
|6|101|Result = ~(operand1 & operand2)|
|7|110|Result = ~(operand1 | operand2)|
|8|111|Result = operand1 ^ operand2|
